# Fits and Regression

This activity gives students an opportunity to use Scipy to fit data and Matplotlib to display the fit.

## Instructions

1. Open [crime.ipynb](Unsolved/crime.ipynb) file and execute the starter code. This starter code will import the dependencies you will need as well as load the FBI CIUS (Crime in the United States 2013) dataset.

1. Generate a scatter plot with Matplotlib using the year as the independent (*x*) variable and the violent crime rate as the dependent (*y*) variable.

1. Use `stats.linregress` to perform a linear regression with the year as the independent variable (*x*) and the violent crime rate as the dependent variable (*y*).

1. Use the information returned by `stats.linregress` to create the equation of a line from the model.

1. Calculate the predicted violent crime rate of the linear model using the year as the *x* values.

1. Plot the linear model of year versus violent crime rate on top of your scatter plot.

    * **Hint**: Your scatter plot and line plot share the same axis.

    * **Hint**: In order to overlay plots in a notebook, the plots must be in the same code block.

1. Repeat the process of generating a scatter plot, calculating the linear regression model, and plotting the regression line over the scatter plot for the following pairs of variables:

      * Year versus murder rate.

      * Year versus aggravated assault.

## Bonus

1. Use `pyplot.subplots` from Matplotlib to create a new figure that displays all three pairs of variables on the same plot. For each pair of variables, there should be a scatter plot and a regression line.

    * **Hint**: All three plots share the same x-axis.

1. Use the regression lines you created to predict what the violent crime rate, murder rate, and assault rate will be in 2019.


## Hints

* See the documentation for [stats.linregress](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.19.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.linregress.html).

* Recall that `stats.linregress` returns a slope, called *m*,, and a *y*-intercept, called *b*. These let you define a line for each fit by simply writing: `y-values = m * x-values + b`, for each linear regression you perform.
