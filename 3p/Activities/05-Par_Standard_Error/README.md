# SEM and Error Bars

## Instructions

Work with a partner on this activity. Be sure to compare your calculated values as you progress through the activity.

1. Open the [samples.ipynb](Unsolved/samples.ipynb) in the activity folder.

1. Execute the starter code to import the Boston housing data set from scikit-learn.

1. Create a sample set of median housing prices using Pandas. Be sure to create samples of size 20.

1. Calculate the means and standard error for each sample.

1. Create a plot displaying the means for each sample, with the standard error as error bars.

1. Calculate the range of SEM values across the sample set.

1. Determine which sample has the lowest standard error value.

1. Compare this sample's mean to the population's mean.

1. Rerun your sampling code a few times to generate new sample sets. Try changing the sample size and rerunning the sampling code.

1. Discuss with your partner what changes you observe when sample size changes.
