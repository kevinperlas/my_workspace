# Correlation Conquerors

This activity gives students an opportunity to use SciPy to compare factors across the scikit-learn's wine recognition dataset.

The wine recognition dataset is "the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy by three different cultivators." Measurements of 13 different constituents are taken for three types of wine.

## Instructions

1. Open [correlations.ipynb](Activities/07-Stu_Correlation_Conquerors/Unsolved/correlations.ipynb) in the activity folder.

1. Execute the starter code to import the wine recognition dataset from scikit-learn.

1. Using the dataset, plot the factors malic acid versus flavanoids on a scatter plot. Is this relationship positively correlated, negatively correlated, or not correlated? How strong is the correlation?

1. Calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient for  malic acid versus flavanoids. Compare the correlation coefficient to the Strength of Correlation table below. Was your prediction correct?

1. Plot the factors alcohol versus color intensity on a scatter plot. Is this relationship positively correlated, negatively correlated, or not correlated? How strong is the correlation?

1. Calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient for alcohol versus color intensity. Compare the correlation coefficient to the Strength of Correlation table. Was your prediction correct?

## Bonus

1. Look at the [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) to find how to generate a correlation matrix. This matrix will contain the Pearson's correlation coefficient for all pairs of factors in the DataFrame.

1. Generate the correlation matrix and try to find the pair of factors that generate the strongest positive and strongest negative correlations.
